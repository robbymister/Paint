In this file, you are able to draw 3 different types of shapes; Rectangles, Circles, Polylines and Squiggles as well as Saving and Loading files giving that they're in the proper format. This was a combination betwe assignment from a second year course in Software Design. Working on adding the Square and completing some User Stories I did not finish and personalizing it.
